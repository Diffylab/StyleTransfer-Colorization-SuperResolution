# Demos
Demonstration implementations of neural network image processing algorithms. Everything is written from scratch in C# and has no dependencies on third-party libraries. Windows XP and above, .NET Framework 4.0 and above are required to run. Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4.5 are recommended. The bit depth of the system is any.

# Important!

* All the presented implementations are inferior in performance to the corresponding author's codes. All materials presented in this repository are intended solely for reference and are aimed at the ability to run neural networks "out of the box" on home PCs, and not for regular use. However, despite this, we are constantly working on optimization ;)
* The programs presented are extremely resource-intensive. Despite the theoretical possibility of running them on older PCs, you should not expect a high speed of codes even on modern machines.
* Commercial use of some algorithms implemented here is prohibited by the authors. Carefully study the license in the official repositories!
* Detailed instructions on how to run implementations can be found in the file [MANUAL.md](https://github.com/ColorfulSoft/StyleTransfer-Colorization-SuperResolution/blob/master/MANUAL.md).
